    "In this Colab, we present a step-by-step guide on fine-tuning Whisper with Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Transformers and Datasets in less than X lines of code. Using streaming mode, we'll show how you can train a speech recongition model on any dataset, irrespective of size! With streaming mode, storage requirements are no longer a consideration: you can train a model on whatever dataset you want, even if it's download size exceeds your devices disk space. How can this be possible? It simply seems too good to be true! Well, rest assured it's not ðŸ˜‰ Carry on reading to find out more."

    "Speech recognition datasets are large. A typical speech dataset consists of approximately 100 hours of audio-transcription data, requiring upwards of 130GB of storage space for download and preparation. For most ASR researchers, this is already at the upper limit of what is feasible for disk space. So what happens when we want to train on a larger dataset? The full LibriSpeech datasets consists of 960 hours of audio data. Kensho's SPGISpeech contains 5,000 hours of audio data. ML Commons People's Speech contains **30,000+** hours of audio data! Do we need to bite the bullet and buy additional storage? Or is there a way we can train on these datasets with just X GB of disk capacity?\n",
    "\n",
    "When training machine learning systems, we rarely use the entire dataset at once. We typically _batch_ our data into smaller subsets of data, and pass these incrementally through our training pipeline. This is because we train our system on an accelerator device, such as a GPU or TPU, which has a memory limit typically around 16GB. We have to fit our model, optimiser and training batch all on the same accelerator device, so we usually divide the dataset up into batches and move them from the CPU to the GPU when required. Consequently, we don't require the entire dataset to be downloaded at once - we simply need the batch of data that we pass to our model at any one go. We can leverage this principle of partial dataset download when preparing our dataset - rather than downloading the enitre dataset at the start, we can download each piece of data as and when we need it, pass it through the training pipeline, and then delete it once we are finished. In doing so, we only ever need as much disk space as each individual batch requires!\n",
    "\n",
    "While this sounds ideal, it also seems **pretty** difficult to do. Luckily for us, ðŸ¤— Datasets allows us to do this with minimal code changes! We'll make use of the prinicple of [_streaming_](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/stream). Streaming achieves exactly this: the data is downloaded progressively as we iterate over the dataset, meaning it is only downloaded as and when we need it for training. If you're familiar with training ðŸ¤— models, the content of this notebook will be familiar, with some small extensions to support streaming mode."
