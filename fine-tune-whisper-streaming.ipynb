With streaming mode, storage requirements are no longer a consideration: you can train a model on whatever dataset you want, even if it's download size exceeds your devices disk space.

    "Speech recognition datasets are large. A typical speech dataset consists of approximately 100 hours of audio-transcription data, requiring upwards of 130GB of storage space for download and preparation. For most ASR researchers, this is already at the upper limit of what is feasible for disk space. So what happens when we want to train on a larger dataset? The full [LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr) dataset consists of 960 hours of audio data. Kensho's [SPGISpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kensho/spgispeech) contains 5,000 hours of audio data. ML Commons [People's Speech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MLCommons/peoples_speech) contains **30,000+** hours of audio data! Do we need to bite the bullet and buy additional storage? Or is there a way we can train on these datasets with just 20GB of disk capacity?\n",
    "\n",
    "When training machine learning systems, we rarely use the entire dataset at once. We typically _batch_ our data into smaller subsets of data, and pass these incrementally through our training pipeline. This is because we train our system on an accelerator device, such as a GPU or TPU, which has a memory limit typically around 16GB. We have to fit our model, optimiser and training data all on the same accelerator device, so we usually divide the dataset up into batches and move them from the CPU to the GPU when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we don't require the entire dataset to be downloaded at once - we simply need the batch of data that we pass to our model at any one go. We can leverage this principle of partial dataset download when preparing our dataset - rather than downloading the enitre dataset at the start, we can download each piece of data as and when we need it, pass it through the training pipeline, and then delete it once we are finished. In doing so, we only ever need as much disk space as each individual batch requires!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, downloading the data on a batch-by-batch basis has its drawbacks. When training, we typically _shuffle_ our training data to randomly order it across the dataset. This helps the model learn **global** statistics with each training batch, rather than **local** patterns. The problem with downloading the data on a batch-by-batch basis is that we'll only ever use **consecutive** data samples in our training batches (those that appear next to each other in the training dataset). Ideally, we want to be able to perform some kind of shuffling across our dataset to promote the learning of global statistics. For full dataset shuffling, we have to download the entire dataset, but this is often insfeasible as explained above. Therefore, we interpolate somewhere inbetween the batch-by-batch and full dataset shuffling. We download a small _subset_ of the dataset at a time: more data than in a batch, but less than the full dataset. We then shuffle the data across this subset and form batches for training. This gives an approximation to full dataset shuffling. We can set the size of this subset based on our disk space requirements. The smaller this subset, the less storage required, but the closer to a batch-by-batch approach. The larger this subset, the more storage required, but the closer to full dataset shuffling.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the principle of subset download sounds ideal, it also seems **pretty** difficult to do. Luckily for us, ðŸ¤— Datasets allows us to do this with minimal code changes! We'll make use of the prinicple of [_streaming_](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/stream), depicted graphically in Figure 1. Streaming achieves exactly this: the data is downloaded progressively as we iterate over the dataset, meaning it is only downloaded as and when we need it for training. If you're familiar with training ðŸ¤— models, the content of this notebook will be familiar, with some small extensions to support streaming mode."
